# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

To start accept the github repo invitation and clone it to your desktop. Then create your own Github Codespace (https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview).
Once you have your codespace set up you can run docker-compose up to start the server. You can check it has started by pointing your browser to https://obelusfamily-anythink-market-tau4j-4w5jgxrr4rrfjpp-3000.githubpreview.dev/api/ping. Once everything works you can register yourself as a new user on: https://obelusfamily-anythink-market-tau4j-4w5jgxrr4rrfjpp-3001.githubpreview.dev/register
